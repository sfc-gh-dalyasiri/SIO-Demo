- No access to live data
- Can't take actions
- Limited to pre-programmed scenarios

**SIO Agentic AI:**
- ✅ **Dynamic tool selection** - Chooses right tool(s) for each query
- ✅ **Live data access** - Queries real Snowflake database
- ✅ **Multi-source intelligence** - Combines data + documents + web
- ✅ **Action capability** - Sends emails, generates reports
- ✅ **Complex workflows** - Orchestrates multiple tools for sophisticated tasks
- ✅ **Context awareness** - Understands user intent and provides relevant answers
- ✅ **Scalable automation** - Can handle bulk operations

**This is the power of Agentic AI!**

## 📋 **WHAT TO TEST IN SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE UI**

### Quick Tests (Verify Each Tool Works):
```
1. "How many customers do we have?" 
   Expected: irrigation_data tool, returns 1000

2. "What are the payment methods?"
   Expected: knowledge_base tool, returns billing policy

3. "Check weather for Riyadh"
   Expected: web_scrape tool, returns forecast

4. "Send test email to test@example.com"
   Expected: send_email tool, asks confirmation
```

### Comprehensive Tests (Show Value):
```
5. "Which regions have water below 50% capacity?"
   Expected: Data query with POSITIVE framing

6. "My bill is high - what can I do?"
   Expected: Usage data + conservation tips (2 tools)

7. "Analyze Qassim and send report to manager@sio.gov.sa"
   Expected: Data analysis + email (multi-tool)

8. "Plan for summer: show trends and check weather"
   Expected: Historical data + web scrape (complete planning)
```

### Edge Cases (Verify Intelligence):
```

## ⚠️ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

### ML Prediction UDF - Needs Fix (Non-Blocking)
**Issue:** Python syntax errors in PREDICT_WATER_DEMAND function  
**Impact:** ML predictions tab in Streamlit won't work  
**Workaround:** All other functionality works fine  
**Priority:** Can be fixed post-demo  
**Complexity:** Medium (minor Python syntax corrections)

### Email Tool - External Dependency
**Note:** Uses shared ALGHANIM_DATAGEN.DM_FNB.SP_SEND_AGENT_EMAIL  
**Consideration:** May need SIO-specific email procedure for production  
**For Demo:** Works perfectly with existing procedure

### Web Scrape - External Dependency
**Note:** Uses shared ALGHANIM_DATAGEN.DM_FNB.WEB_SCRAPE  
**Consideration:** May want SIO-specific implementation for production  
**For Demo:** Works perfectly
