## 🎯 **KEY FIXES APPLIED**

### **Issue 1: Streamlit Config Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `set_page_config() can only be called once`  
**Solution:** Moved `st.set_page_config()` before any other Streamlit commands  
**Status:** ✅ App now runs without errors

### **Issue 2: Table Relationships Missing** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** "Semantic model does not define any relationships between tables"  
**Solution:** Added 5 relationships to semantic model:
- customer_to_region
- water_source_to_region
- billing_to_customer
- water_usage_to_meter
- meter_to_customer

**Status:** ✅ Agent can now answer cross-table queries like:
- "Total revenue from customers growing dates"
- "Water usage by region and crop type"
- "Billing by customer type and region"
